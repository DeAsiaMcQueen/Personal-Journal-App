A secure and feature-rich personal journal app designed to store, search, and export encrypted entries with user authentication.
## Features
- Authentication: Login/Registration system for user accounts.
- Secure Encryption: For data privacy, journal entries are encrypted using `cryptography`.
- Rich Interface: Intuitive GUI with entry creation, category selection, and timestamping.
- Search and Filter: Find journal entries by title, category, or date range.
- Export Functionality: Save journal entries as a `.txt` or `.csv` file.
- Timestamp Accuracy: Localized timestamp is based on the userâ€™s timezone.

# Accessing Encrypted Entries Directly
1. All journal entries are encrypted in the SQLite database for security.
2. To view these encrypted entries manually
   - Download and install DB Browser for SQLite.
   - Open the journal.db file in DB Browser.
   - Browse the journal_entries table to see encrypted data in the entry column.
   - Note: Encrypted data in the database can only be decrypted using this application with the correct encryption key.
